You will need the javascript files in here.

We don't automatically pull from git latest javascript
version of library (eg snackabra-jslib), you will need
to copy (overwrite) the version you want in the 
documentation into this directory.

You can do ``make jslib`` in the top directory.

Any other javascript files you want jsdoc/sphinx to find
also need to be here.
