=========
Snackabra
=========

Snackabra is a new technology stack for building private, secure, and sovereign applications. 
It revisits and redefines the conventional architecture of apps on the internet.

Why a whole new stack? We found that creating simple chat and social media apps from scratch that encapsulate a modern (2020s) understanding of privacy, security, and sovereignty was not possible with existing solutions.

Whereas conventionally the 'platform' layer resides on servers - whether they be edge-based or in datacenters - the Snackabra (SB) architecture is fundamentally different: the application layer remains the same (eg static web sites, React applications, etc), but the platform layer has migrated from servers “behind” the internet backbone into your client (browser). The platform layer in turn still talks to servers somewhere, but now in the form of two composable low-level primitives: channels (communication) and shards (block storage).

The platform layer is encapsulated in a `single, standalone Typescript library <https://github.com/snackabra/snackabra-jslib/blob/main/src/snackabra.ts>`_. The infrastructure layer is defined by protocols, with reference server implementations `available on Github <https://github.com/snackabra>`_.

For motivation and design principles, see the :ref:`general discussion
<discussion>` section.

To jump into some of the technical design details, you might want to start with a
:ref:`slightly technical introduction <introduction>` and then dig
into :ref:`more detailed overview <overview>`.

Commercial development is being pursued by 384 (https://384.co),
but all the core pieces (platform library, reference servers, template clients, etc)
are open source. If you would like to contribute
or help out with the snackabra project, please feel free to :ref:`reach out to us <contact>`.

This is work in progress, there's much left to do. Design was begun in
2020 and implementation was begun in 2021, and first public release
was in February, 2022. The design and implementation leveraged 
various other projects done at the `Institute <https://Magnusson.Institute>`_ in 2018-2021.

So please be patient if and when we need to change (sometimes fundamental) things. [#f04]_

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f02] "SNACKABRA" is pronounced "snack" and then the first part of
   "abracadabra". Accent is on the second "a" (the first "a" in
   "abracadabra"). It's as easy to use as having a snack. And
   it's magical.

.. [#f03] Though bear in mind that the :ref:`license language <license>` will never cease to apply: this is provided "as is".

.. [#f04] The canary function for all of Snackabra's open source technology is @psm's
   personal twitter (https://twitter.com/petersmagnusson).
   You can DM at any time to ask if there are any known "constraints"
   in effect that might impact the integrity of any parts of the design, implementation, algorithms, etc.
   You will get a reply iff there are not any. If you don't know what this footnote means, don't worry about it.
